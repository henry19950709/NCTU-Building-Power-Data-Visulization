# NCTU-Building-Power-Data-Visulization
Make Data Visualization on the Engineer building in the NCTU about Temperature, humidity, power consumption and yearly usage.

## Libraries (in Python)
* lxml
* bokeh
* pandas
* ftplib
* BeautifulSoup
* requests

Note: Someone wants to run the code should install these libraries.

## Concept
First, I write a python crawler to pull the power data from the website which NCTU puts all the buildings' power consumption data on. I just use six building from E1 to E6.

Second, I use the libraries above to make some charts like bar, pie and line charts. The following picture is an example.
